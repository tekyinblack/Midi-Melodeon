# Midi-Melodeon

This is the code repository for a project to build a midi melodeon around an Arduino
It is based on an original instrument and uses IR sensors to detect key presses, pressure sensors to detect bellows movement, converting
these into midi signals for transmission via bluetooth.

The project was shelved a few years ago due to time constraints so the code is here for anyone to view
